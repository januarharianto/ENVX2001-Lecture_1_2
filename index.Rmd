## Disability Services Office (02) 8627 8422

- Do you have a disability that impacts on your studies?
- You may not think of yourself as having a ‘disability’ but the definition under the Disability Discrimination Act (1992) is broad and includes temporary or chronic medical conditions, physical or sensory disabilities, psychological conditions and learning disabilities. 

- The types of disabilities we see include:
  - Anxiety // Arthritis // Asthma // Autism // ADHD
  - Bipolar disorder // Broken bones // Cancer  
  - Cerebral palsy // Chronic fatigue syndrome  
  - Crohn’s disease // Cystic fibrosis // Depression Diabetes // Dyslexia // Epilepsy // Hearing impairment // Learning disability // Mobility impairment // Multiple sclerosis // Post-traumatic stress // Schizophrenia  // Vision impairment and much more.
- In order to get assistance, students need to [register with Disability Services](sydney.edu.au/disability). It is advisable to do this as early as possible. Please contact us or review our website to find out more.

- A minimum 80% attendance is required in workshops (tutorial + practical).
- Workshop attendance is very important for groupwork as well as learning.
- There is a strong correlation between class attendance and performance.

## Designs: Why do we care?

> 
> *“That’s not an experiment you have there, that’s an experience."*

## Arithmetric mean

- Population mean, $\mu$:  sum of all values of a variable divided by the number of objects in the population

$$\mu = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_i} {N}$$
- Sample mean  is based on a subset of n objects from a population of size N 

$$\bar{y} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_i} {n}$$

> The $\Sigma$ symbol refers to the *sum*, and conveniently displays $x_1+x_2+x_3+\cdots +x_n$.

## Variance and Standard Deviation (SD)

- Metrics to describe *variation* around arithmetric mean
- Variance
  - Describes variation in *squared* deviations of the mean, i.e. $unit^2$
  - Population variance: $\sigma^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \mu)^2} {N}$
  - Sample variance: $\sigma^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \mu)^2} {n-1}$
- Standard deviation
  - Describes variation in *original* units
  - Population standard deviation: $\sigma = \sqrt\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \mu)^2} {N}$
  - Sample standard variation: $\sigma = \sqrt\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \mu)^2} {n-1}$










---
## Distributions

- When we measure things, we are taking a random sample, $n$, from a larger population, $N$
- From this we calculate statistics, e.g. the mean, but if we repeatedly did this we would observe different values of the mean – this the **sampling distribution**
- Since we can only sample 1 time, what do we know about the **sampling distribution**? 










---
## Distributions

.pull-left[

- **Population** distribution -- distribution of all individuals in the population
- **Sample** distribution -- distribution of all individuals in the sample
- **Sampling** distribution -- distribution of a statistic from all possible samples

.pull-right[
![:scale 100%](assets/sampledist.png)

.center[
Soil carbon ~ $N (70, 6.70^2)$
]

]

.center[So how well do we know the sample mean?]










---
## Standard error of the mean

- Like the standard deviation of a distribution, called standard error to avoid confusion
- Tells us how well we know the mean

$$se(\bar y) = \sqrt \frac{s^2}{n} = \frac{s}{\sqrt n}$$

- Depends on number of observations ($n$) and variation in the data ($\sigma$)

## Effect of sample size

Soil Carbon ~ $N(70, x^2)$

> How confident are we that this represents the true mean?

Step 1: what is the standard deviation? what is the sample size?

```{r}
sd(soil)
length(soil)
```

Step 2: what is standard error of the mean?

```{r}
sqrt(var(soil)/7) # sem manual calculation
```
]












---
## Central Limit Theorem

- If data is normally distributed then the distribution of sample means is normally distributed
- **Central limit theorem**: for almost all distributions (log, gamma), as $n$ (the sample size) increases, the distribution of sample means tends to become more normal

---
## Confidence intervals

- Consist of an
  - interval [lower, upper limit]
  - degree of confidence [a %, e.g. 95%]
- Definition:  informally it is the interval in which we would expect to find the population mean (μ).  More formally if we worked out a series of CIs for a series of samples, then 95% of the CIs would contain the population mean.
  - CI’s can be estimated for other parameters but so far we have only focused on the mean
  - The 95% CI for the mean is:

$$95\% CI = \bar y \pm t_{n-1}^{0.025} \times se(\bar y)$$
